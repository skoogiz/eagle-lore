Simple application for creating and generating monsters for your RPG:s. The rules app is mostly written based on the classic Swedish RPG [Drakar & Demoner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drakar_och_Demoner). 
Main purpose for the code has been showing some simple coding basics to a friend that tries getting into coding.

## Base functionality
### Create Monsters
This functionality covers creating a template of a monster. It will handle what dices and modifiers that are going to be used for generating a monsters ability values.

### Generate a playable monster
Here you take a given template and generates the stats and get a playable monster.

## Dependencies
### Backend
[Spark](http://sparkjava.com), a micro framework for creating web application.

### Frontend
[JQuery](https://jquery.com), my goto javascript library.

[MUI](https://www.muicss.com), a lightweight CSS framework for making the small html snippets looking somewhat presentable.
